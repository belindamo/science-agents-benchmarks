## CS197 Analysis Framework

### Problem
- **Core Problem:** Need to evaluate AI agents' ability to autonomously replicate state-of-the-art AI research
- **Why it Matters:** Autonomous research replication could accelerate ML progress but requires careful evaluation for safety
- **Critical Application:** Benchmark serves as measure for model autonomy in multiple safety frameworks (OpenAI Preparedness, Anthropic RSP, DeepMind Frontier Safety)

### Assumption in Prior Work
- **Prior Assumption:** AI research capabilities can be evaluated through code generation or general problem-solving tasks
- **Inadequacy:** Existing evaluations don't capture the full complexity of autonomous research replication
- **Missing Elements:** No assessment of complete research pipeline from paper understanding to experimental execution

### Insight
- **Novel Contribution:** **Complete research replication evaluation** - from paper comprehension to experimental validation
- **Key Innovation:** Hierarchical task decomposition with author-validated rubrics
- **Breakthrough:** LLM-based judge system for scalable evaluation with dedicated judge benchmark

### Technical Overview
- **Dataset:** 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers
- **Task Scope:** Complete replication including:
  - Paper understanding
  - Codebase development from scratch
  - Experiment execution and troubleshooting
- **Evaluation Framework:**
  - 8,316 individually gradable tasks
  - Hierarchical rubric structure
  - Co-developed with original paper authors
- **Judge System:** LLM-based automatic grading with separate judge benchmark

### Proof
- **Performance Results:**
  - Best agent (Claude 3.5 Sonnet): 21.0% average replication score
  - Human baseline: Top ML PhDs significantly outperform models
- **Validation:** Direct comparison with human experts on same tasks
- **Scale:** Comprehensive evaluation across diverse ML research areas
