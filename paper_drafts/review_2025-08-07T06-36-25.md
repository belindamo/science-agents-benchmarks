# Research Paper Review
## Summary

The paper proposes the development of benchmarks for scientific discovery, similar to existing benchmarks like HELM and PaperBench, but focused on science-specific tasks. It references Sakana AI's AI Scientist project, which has achieved the milestone of producing a fully AI-generated paper that passed peer review at an ICLR workshop. The paper suggests using both LLM judges and human experts to evaluate the benchmarks, aiming to improve the correlation between AI and human assessments.

## Strengths
- Addresses a significant gap in the evaluation of AI-driven scientific discovery.
- Proposes a novel approach by combining LLM and human evaluations.
- Builds on the achievements of Sakana AI's AI Scientist project, which has demonstrated the potential of AI in scientific research.

## Weaknesses
- The paper lacks detailed methodology for the proposed benchmarks.
- Limited discussion on how the benchmarks will address the current limitations of AI systems in scientific discovery.
- The paper does not provide empirical results or validation of the proposed approach.

## Questions for Authors
1. How will the proposed benchmarks specifically address the limitations identified in existing AI systems?
2. What criteria will be used to select the human experts for evaluation?
3. How will the benchmarks be validated to ensure they accurately assess AI capabilities in scientific discovery?

## Limitations
- The proposed benchmarks may still require significant human oversight.
- There is a risk that the benchmarks may not fully capture the complexity of scientific discovery processes.
