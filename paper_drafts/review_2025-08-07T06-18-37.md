# Research Paper Review
## Summary

The paper proposes the development of benchmarks for scientific discovery, similar to existing benchmarks like HELM and PaperBench, but focused on science-specific tasks. It references Sakana AI's AI Scientist project, which has produced AI-generated papers that passed peer review at an ICLR workshop, highlighting both achievements and limitations. The paper suggests using LLM judges and human experts to evaluate the benchmarks, aiming to improve the correlation between AI and human assessments.

## Strengths
- Addresses a gap in benchmarking for scientific discovery tasks.
- Proposes a novel approach by combining LLM and human evaluations.
- Builds on existing successful benchmarks like HELM and PaperBench.

## Weaknesses
- Limited discussion on the specific design and implementation of the proposed benchmarks.
- Relies heavily on the achievements of Sakana AI's AI Scientist project, which has notable limitations.
- Lacks empirical validation or preliminary results to support the proposed approach.

## Questions for Authors
1. How will the proposed benchmarks specifically address the limitations identified in existing AI systems?
2. What criteria will be used to select the human experts for evaluation?
3. How will the benchmarks be validated to ensure they accurately assess scientific discovery capabilities?

## Limitations
- The proposed benchmarks may not fully capture the complexity of scientific discovery tasks.
- Potential over-reliance on LLMs, which have known limitations in understanding complex scientific concepts.
