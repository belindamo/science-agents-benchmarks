# Research Paper Review
## Summary

The paper proposes the development of benchmarks for scientific discovery, akin to existing benchmarks like HELM and PaperBench, but specifically tailored for science-related tasks. It draws inspiration from Sakana AI's AI Scientist project, which has demonstrated the potential for AI systems to autonomously conduct scientific research, albeit with notable limitations. The proposed benchmarks aim to evaluate AI systems' capabilities in scientific discovery, incorporating both LLM and human expert evaluations.

## Strengths
- Addresses a significant gap in the evaluation of AI systems for scientific discovery.
- Proposes a novel approach by integrating human expert evaluations with LLM assessments.
- Builds upon existing benchmarking efforts, extending them to science-specific tasks.

## Weaknesses
- The paper lacks detailed methodology for the proposed benchmarks.
- Limited discussion on how to address the identified limitations of current AI systems.
- The feasibility of obtaining consistent human expert evaluations is not thoroughly explored.

## Questions for Authors
1. How will the proposed benchmarks specifically address the limitations identified in current AI systems?
2. What criteria will be used to select human experts for evaluations?
3. How will the benchmarks ensure consistency and reliability in human expert assessments?

## Limitations
- The proposed benchmarks may face challenges in scalability due to reliance on human evaluations.
- Potential bias in human expert assessments could affect the reliability of the benchmarks.
