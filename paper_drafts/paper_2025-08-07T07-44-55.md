# Research Paper Review
## Summary

The paper proposes creating a set of benchmarks for scientific discovery, similar to existing benchmarks like HELM, but specifically tailored for science tasks. It references Sakana AI's AI Scientist project and suggests using both LLM judges and human experts for evaluation. The paper aims to assess the correlation between human and LLM evaluations in scientific tasks.

## Strengths
- Addresses a gap in benchmarking scientific discovery tasks.
- Proposes a novel combination of LLM judges and human experts for evaluation.
- Builds on existing successful projects like Sakana AI's AI Scientist.

## Weaknesses
- The originality of the benchmark concept is limited due to existing similar benchmarks.
- The paper lacks detailed experimental results to support its claims.
- Potential challenges in ensuring the reliability and consistency of LLM judges.

## Questions for Authors
1. How will the benchmarks be validated to ensure they accurately assess scientific discovery capabilities?
2. What measures will be taken to address potential biases in LLM judges?

## Limitations
- The reliance on LLM judges may introduce biases and inconsistencies.
- The benchmarks may not fully capture the complexity of scientific discovery processes.
