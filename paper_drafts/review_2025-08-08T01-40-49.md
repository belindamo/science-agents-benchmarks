# Research Paper Review
## Summary

The paper proposes the development of benchmarks for scientific discovery, akin to existing benchmarks like HELM and PaperBench, but specifically tailored for science-related tasks. It draws inspiration from Sakana AI's AI Scientist project, which has achieved the milestone of producing AI-generated papers that passed peer review at an ICLR workshop, albeit with notable limitations. The proposed benchmarks aim to evaluate AI's capabilities in scientific discovery by incorporating both LLM and human evaluations.

## Strengths
- Addresses a significant gap in current AI benchmarking by focusing on science-specific tasks.
- Incorporates both LLM and human evaluations to provide a comprehensive assessment.
- Builds on existing successful benchmarks like HELM and PaperBench.

## Weaknesses
- The paper lacks detailed methodology for the proposed benchmarks.
- Relies heavily on the achievements of Sakana AI's project, which has notable limitations.
- Does not provide empirical results or pilot studies to support the feasibility of the proposed benchmarks.

## Questions for Authors
1. What specific science tasks will the proposed benchmarks focus on?
