# Research Paper Review
## Summary

The paper proposes the development of benchmarks for scientific discovery, akin to existing benchmarks like HELM and PaperBench, but specifically tailored for science-related tasks. It draws inspiration from Sakana AI's AI Scientist project, which has achieved the milestone of generating a peer-reviewed scientific paper, albeit with significant limitations. The proposed benchmarks aim to evaluate AI systems on science-specific tasks, integrating both human and AI evaluations.

## Strengths
- Addresses a gap in benchmarking AI systems for scientific discovery.
- Proposes integration of human and AI evaluations, which could enhance the reliability of assessments.
- Builds on existing successful frameworks like HELM and PaperBench.

## Weaknesses
- The paper lacks detailed methodology for the proposed benchmarks.
- Relies heavily on the achievements of Sakana AI's AI Scientist project, which has notable limitations.
- Does not provide empirical results or pilot studies to support the feasibility of the proposed benchmarks.

## Questions for Authors
1. How will the proposed benchmarks specifically differ from existing ones like Science-Gym or Auto-Bench?
2. What specific science tasks will the benchmarks cover, and how will they be evaluated?
3. How will human and AI evaluations be integrated in the benchmarking process?

## Limitations
- The proposed benchmarks may face challenges in standardization across diverse scientific fields.
- Potential difficulty in achieving consensus on evaluation criteria between human and AI judges.
