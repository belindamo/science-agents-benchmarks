# Research Paper Review
## Summary

The paper proposes the creation of benchmarks for scientific discovery, similar to existing benchmarks like HELM and PaperBench, but focused on science-specific tasks. It uses Sakana AI's AI Scientist project as a case study, which has achieved the milestone of producing a fully AI-generated paper that passed peer review at an ICLR workshop. The paper suggests using both LLM judges and human experts to evaluate the benchmarks, aiming to improve the correlation between AI and human assessments.

## Strengths
- Addresses a significant gap in benchmarking AI-driven scientific discovery.
- Proposes a novel approach by combining LLM and human evaluations.
- Uses a real-world case study (Sakana AI's AI Scientist) to ground the proposal.

## Weaknesses
- The proposal lacks detailed methodology for implementing the benchmarks.
- Relies heavily on the success of Sakana AI's project, which has notable limitations.
- Does not address the scalability of the proposed benchmarks across different scientific domains.

## Questions for Authors
1. How will the benchmarks be adapted for different scientific domains?
2. What specific metrics will be used to evaluate the benchmarks?
3. How will the proposed benchmarks address the limitations observed in Sakana AI's project?

## Limitations
- The benchmarks may not be easily scalable across diverse scientific fields.
- The reliance on LLM judges may not fully capture the nuances of scientific evaluation.
