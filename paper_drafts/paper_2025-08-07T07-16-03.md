# Research Paper Review
## Summary

The paper proposes creating a set of benchmarks for scientific discovery, similar to existing benchmarks like HELM, but specifically tailored for science tasks. It references Sakana AI's AI Scientist project and suggests using both LLM judges and human experts for evaluation. The paper aims to address the limitations of current AI-driven scientific discovery systems by developing comprehensive benchmarks that evaluate AI capabilities in scientific research.

## Strengths
- Addresses a significant gap in AI-driven scientific discovery by proposing tailored benchmarks.
- Combines LLM judges with human experts for a more robust evaluation framework.
- Builds on existing successful projects like Sakana AI's AI Scientist and PaperBench.

## Weaknesses
- The paper lacks detailed methodology for implementing the proposed benchmarks.
- Limited discussion on the potential challenges and limitations of using LLM judges.
- Insufficient empirical evidence or preliminary results to support the proposed approach.

## Questions for Authors
1. How will the benchmarks be validated to ensure they accurately assess scientific discovery capabilities?
2. What specific criteria will be used by LLM judges and human experts in the evaluation process?
3. How will the proposed benchmarks address the limitations of existing benchmarks like Auto-Bench and MLR-Bench?

## Limitations
