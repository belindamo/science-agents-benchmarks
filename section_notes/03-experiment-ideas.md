# Experiment Ideas

## Core Research Direction

**Bit Flip**: Current scientific evaluation benchmarks rely on static, isolated task assessment when scientific discovery requires dynamic, holistic pipeline evaluation with human expert validation.

**Research Question**: How can we develop evaluation frameworks that better capture the complexity of scientific discovery while maintaining scalability through AI-human collaborative assessment?

## Experiment 1: LLM-Human Judge Correlation Analysis

### Thesis Statement
LLM judges can achieve high correlation with human expert assessments in scientific evaluation tasks, but the correlation varies significantly across different dimensions of scientific merit and task complexity.

### Hypothesis
**H1**: LLM judges will achieve >0.7 Pearson correlation with human experts on structured evaluation tasks (methodology, reproducibility)
**H2**: LLM judges will achieve <0.5 correlation with human experts on subjective evaluation tasks (novelty, significance)
**H3**: Ensemble LLM+human judge rankings will outperform either alone by >15% on overall scientific merit assessment

### Bit Flip
**Assumption**: LLM judges can effectively substitute for human experts across all dimensions of scientific evaluation  
**Flip**: LLM judges excel at certain structured aspects but require human collaboration for subjective scientific judgments

### Experimental Design

#### Independent Variables
- Judge type: LLM-only, Human-only, LLM+Human ensemble
- Evaluation dimension: Methodology, Reproducibility, Novelty, Significance, Impact
- Task complexity: Simple (single-metric), Moderate (multi-metric), Complex (holistic assessment)

#### Dependent Variables
- Inter-rater reliability (Krippendorff's α)
- Correlation with ground truth expert consensus
- Evaluation consistency across repeated assessments
- Time to complete evaluation

#### Procedure
1. **Dataset Creation**: Select 50 research papers from recent ML conferences (ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR)
2. **Human Expert Panel**: Recruit 5 ML researchers (PhD-level) to provide ground truth ratings
3. **LLM Judge Implementation**: Deploy GPT-4, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-Pro as judges
4. **Evaluation Protocol**: Use PaperBench-inspired hierarchical rubrics with 5-point Likert scales
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Pearson correlation, ICC, bootstrapped confidence intervals

#### Validity Threats & Mitigations
- **Selection bias**: Stratify papers by venue, topic, and methodology type
- **Expert fatigue**: Randomize evaluation order, limit daily evaluations
- **LLM inconsistency**: Use temperature=0, multiple runs with majority voting

#### Expected Outcomes
- Strong LLM performance on structured dimensions (methodology: r>0.8)
- Weak LLM performance on subjective dimensions (novelty: r<0.5)
- Ensemble method achieving highest overall correlation (r>0.85)

#### Resources & Timeline
- **Personnel**: 1 researcher, 5 expert evaluators
- **Compute**: $500 for LLM API calls
- **Timeline**: 6 weeks (2 weeks setup, 3 weeks data collection, 1 week analysis)

## Experiment 2: Dynamic vs Static Scientific Evaluation

### Thesis Statement
Interactive, iterative evaluation frameworks capture scientific discovery capabilities more accurately than static benchmarks, revealing systematic biases in current AI scientific assessment.

### Hypothesis
**H1**: AI agents will show 25% higher performance scores on static vs dynamic versions of the same scientific tasks
**H2**: Static evaluations will over-estimate AI capabilities on complex reasoning by >30% compared to dynamic assessments
**H3**: Human experts will show <10% performance difference between static and dynamic formats

### Bit Flip
**Assumption**: Static evaluation with fixed inputs/outputs adequately captures scientific discovery processes  
**Flip**: Scientific discovery is inherently interactive and iterative, requiring dynamic evaluation frameworks

### Experimental Design

#### Independent Variables
- Evaluation format: Static (single-shot), Dynamic (interactive with feedback)
- Task type: Hypothesis generation, Experimental design, Result interpretation
- Agent type: GPT-4, Claude-3.5, Human experts

#### Dependent Variables
- Task completion accuracy
- Time to solution
- Number of iterations required
- Quality of intermediate steps
- Final solution robustness

#### Procedure
1. **Task Suite Development**: Create 30 scientific reasoning tasks in both static and dynamic formats
2. **Static Protocol**: Single input → single output evaluation
3. **Dynamic Protocol**: Multi-turn interaction with feedback loops and iteration
4. **Participant Groups**: 3 AI models, 15 human experts (5 per domain)
5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Expert-validated rubrics for scientific reasoning quality

#### Expected Outcomes
- Significant performance gap favoring static evaluation for AI agents
- Minimal performance difference for human experts
- Evidence that current benchmarks over-estimate AI scientific capabilities

## Experiment 3: Holistic Scientific Pipeline Assessment

### Thesis Statement
Complete research pipeline evaluation reveals capability gaps invisible in component-level assessments, requiring new evaluation paradigms for AI scientific systems.

### Hypothesis
**H1**: Component performance will poorly predict (<0.4 correlation) end-to-end scientific pipeline performance
**H2**: AI systems will show >50% performance drop when evaluated on complete workflows vs isolated components
**H3**: Pipeline bottlenecks will vary systematically across different scientific domains

### Bit Flip
**Assumption**: Component evaluation (code generation, reasoning, analysis) predicts performance on complete scientific workflows  
**Flip**: Complete research pipeline evaluation necessary as component capabilities don't compose predictably

### Experimental Design

#### Independent Variables
- Evaluation scope: Component-level, Pipeline-level
- Scientific domain: Machine Learning, Physics, Chemistry, Biology
- Pipeline stage: Literature review, Hypothesis formation, Experimental design, Data analysis, Interpretation

#### Dependent Variables
- Stage-wise completion rate
- Overall pipeline success rate
- Error propagation patterns
- Recovery mechanisms effectiveness

#### Procedure
1. **Pipeline Definition**: Map complete research workflows for each domain
2. **Component Benchmarks**: Assess AI performance on isolated pipeline stages
3. **End-to-End Assessment**: Evaluate complete workflow execution
4. **Error Analysis**: Track failure modes and error propagation
5. **Domain Comparison**: Identify systematic patterns across scientific fields

#### Expected Outcomes
- Poor correlation between component and pipeline performance
- Identification of critical bottleneck stages
- Domain-specific failure patterns requiring targeted improvements

## Implementation Priority

1. **Experiment 1** (6 weeks) - Establishes foundation for LLM-human evaluation frameworks
2. **Experiment 2** (8 weeks) - Tests core assumption about evaluation format impact  
3. **Experiment 3** (10 weeks) - Comprehensive pipeline assessment requiring prior insights
